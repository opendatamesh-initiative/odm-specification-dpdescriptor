# General Concepts
Before deep diving into the [Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS)](../resources/specifications/README.md) it's important to set the stage by introducing some general concepts. Most of them are related to the *data mesh paradigm*. This page anyway IS NOT a data mesh guide. It just positions some data mesh concepts in the scope of this specification to avoid a possible source of ambiguity. Check the [Data Mesh Resources](../resources/resources.md) page to find out better resources to start learning more about data mesh.
