# Development Guide

This document describes the Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS) development processes. 

These processes have been established to provide an open and transparent mechanism for evolving DPDS.

When contributing to the DPDS evolution consider the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to better understand expected and unacceptable behavior and [Design Princilples](CHARTER.md) to ensure your proposed changes are effective and well-aligned.

While participating in the specification evolution is a valuable contribution, there are also other popular ways to contribute listed [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)

This document will be adjusted as practicality dictate

## Change Criteria

DPDS evolves through a series of atomic changes. 
We're open to changes, and these can be proposed by anyone.
Changes  may be made when any of the following criteria are met:

* Clarity. The current "way" something is done doesn't make sense, is complicated, or not clear.

* Consistency. A portion of the specification is not consistent with the rest, or with the industry standard terminology.

* Necessary functionality. We are missing functionality because of a certain design of the specification.

* Forward-looking designs. As usage of APIs evolves to new protocols, formats, and patterns, we should always consider what the next important functionality should be.

* Impact. A change will provide impact on a large number of real use cases. We should not be forced to accommodate every use case. We should strive to make the *common* and *important* use cases both well supported and common in the definition of the DPDS. We cannot be edge-case driven.


## Editorial Changes
Editorial changes do not change the interpretation of the specification but instead
improve legibility, fix editorial errors, clear up ambiguity, and improve
examples 

Editorial changes are welcome as PR and can be merged into the specification by a [DPDS Maintainer](GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers) without a formal process.


## Specification Changes
Specification changes  _do_ meaningfully change the interpretation of the specification. 

Small specification changes are welcome as PR and can be merged into the specification by a [DPDS Maintainer](GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers) without a formal process.

Bigger specification changes require a more formal process. This type of contribution must follow a formal RFC (Request For Comments) 
process led by a *[champion](#RFC-Champions)* through a series of *stages* intended to improve *visibility*, 
allow for *discussion* to reach the best solution, and arrive at *consensus*. 
This process becomes even more important as DPDS's community broadens.

### RFC Change Process


1. Start a [discussion](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/discussions) of type "Brainstorm".  The discussion entry must describe at least the problem it wants to solve and why it matters. At this stage, a description of the possible solution is not required. If there is engagement and support for the proposal over time, then it can be considered as a candidate to move to the next stage.

2. If the suggested change has good support, you will be asked to create a formal RFC issue using the specific template.

3. The RFC will be more closely reviewed and commented on or amended through a series of *stages* until it is either rejected or accepted.
4. At that point, the proposal is merged to the appropriate version of the specification.

Questions are welcome on the process and at any time. Use the discussions feature or find us in [Slack].


#### RFC Champions

Contributing to DPDS requires a lot of dedicated work. To set clear
expectations and provide accountability, each proposed RFC (request for
comments) must have a *champion* who is responsible for addressing feedback and
completing next steps. An RFC may have multiple *champions*. [DPDS Maintainers](GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers)
are not responsible for completing RFCs which lack a *champion* (though a
[DPDS Maintainer](GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers) may be a *champion* for an RFC).

An RFC which does not have a *champion* may not progress through stages, and can
become stale. Stale proposals may be picked up by a new *champion* or may
be *rejected*.

A champion is anyone who leads the work on an RFC. It doesn't
mean it has to be the only person working on it though. They
are a "person of reference" for a given RFC implementation and
may or may not know about JS, relying on the help of other
community members to implement the RFC on the [DPDS JSON Schema](schemas/latest/schema.json).


#### RFC Contribution Stages

RFCs are guided by a *champion* through a series of stages: *strawman*,
*proposal*, *draft*, and *accepted* (or *rejected*), each of which has suggested
entrance criteria and next steps detailed below. RFCs typically advance one
stage at a time, but may advance multiple stages at a time. Stage
advancements occur on GitHub.

Every RFC must have a dedicated issue used to track its evolution through stages.

All RFCs start as either a *strawman* or *proposal*.

##### Stage 0: *Strawman*

An RFC at the *strawman* stage captures a described problem or
partially-considered solutions. A *strawman* does not need to meet any entrance
criteria. A *strawman's* goal is to prove or disprove a problem and guide
discussion towards either rejection or a preferred solution.

*There is no entrance criteria for a Strawman*

As implied by the name [strawman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man_proposal),
the goal at this stage is to knock it down (*reject*) by considering other
possible related solutions, showing that the motivating problem can be solved
with no change to the specification, or that it is not aligned with the
*guiding principles*.

Once determined that the *strawman* is compelling, it should seek the entrance
criteria for *proposal*.


##### Stage 1: *Proposal*

An RFC at the *proposal* stage is a solution to a problem with enough fidelity
to be discussed in detail. It must be backed by a willing *champion*. A
*proposal*'s goal is to make a compelling case for acceptance by describing
both the problem and the solution via examples. 

*Entrance criteria:*

* Identified *champion*
* Clear explanation of problem and solution
* Illustrative examples
* Incomplete spec edits in a feature branch linked with the issue
* Identification of potential concerns, challenges, and drawbacks

A *proposal* is subject to the same discussion as a *strawman*: ensuring that it
is well aligned with the *guiding principles*, is a problem worth solving, and
is the preferred solution to that problem. A *champion* is not expected to have
confidence in every detail at this stage and should instead focus on identifying
and resolving issues and edge-cases. 

Most *proposals* are expected to evolve or change and may be rejected. Therefore,
it is unwise to rely on a *proposal* in a production environment. DPDS-compliant
tools *may* implement *proposals*, though are encouraged to not enable the
*proposed* feature without explicit opt-in.


##### Stage 2: *Draft*

An RFC at the *draft* stage is a fully formed solution. There is
consensus the problem identified should be solved, and this particular solution
is preferred. A *draft's* goal is to precisely and completely describe the
solution and resolve any concerns. 

*Entrance criteria:*

* Consensus on the solution is preferred
* Resolution of identified concerns and challenges
* Complete spec edits, including examples and prose in a feature branch linked with the issue
* Compliant implementation in [DPDS JSON Schema](schemas/latest/schema.json) 

A *proposal* becomes a *draft* when the set of problems or drawbacks have been
fully considered and accepted or resolved, and the solution is deemed
desirable. A *draft*'s goal is to complete final spec edits that are ready to
be merged.

*Drafts* may continue to evolve and change, occasionally dramatically, and are
not guaranteed to be accepted. Therefore, it is unwise to rely on a *draft* in a
production environment. DPDS-compliant tools *should* implement *drafts* to
provide valuable feedback, though are encouraged not to enable the *draft*
feature without explicit opt-in when possible.


##### Stage 3: *Accepted*

An RFC at the *accepted* stage is a completed solution. It's the TSC that MUST accept or reject an RFC through a vote
of its members.

*Entrance criteria:*

* Consensus the solution is complete
* Complete spec edits, including examples and prose
* Compliant implementation in the [DPDS JSON Schema](schemas/latest/schema.json) (fully tested and merged or ready to merge)

A *draft* is *accepted* when the [DPDS Maintainers](GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers) have been convinced that it appropriately handles all edge cases; that the
spec changes not only precisely describe the new syntax and semantics but
include sufficient motivating prose and examples; and that the RFC includes
edits to any other affected areas of the spec. Once *accepted*, its *champion*
should encourage the adoption of the RFC by opening issues or pull requests on other
popular DPDS-compliant tools.

An *accepted* RFC is merged into the DPDS's master branch by a [DPDS Maintainer](GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers)
and will be included in the next released revision.


##### Stage X: *Rejected*

An RFC may be *rejected* at any point and for any reason. It's the [TSC](GOVERNANCE.md#technical-steering-committee) that MUST accept or reject an RFC through a vote
of its members.

Most rejections occur when a *strawman* is proven to be unnecessary, is misaligned with the *guiding
principles*, or fails to meet the entrance criteria to become a *proposal*.
A *proposal* may become *rejected* for similar reasons as well as if it fails to
reach consensus or loses the confidence of its *champion*. Likewise a *draft*
may encounter unforeseen issues during implementations which cause it to lose
consensus or the confidence of its *champion*.

RFCs which have lost a *champion* will not be *rejected* immediately, but may
become *rejected* if they fail to attract a new *champion*.

Once *rejected*, an RFC will typically not be reconsidered. Reconsideration is
possible if a *champion* believes the original reason for rejection no longer
applies due to new circumstances or new evidence.

## Participation

While the governance of the specification is the role of the [TSC](GOVERNANCE.md#technical-steering-committee), the evolution of the specification happens through the participation of members of the community at large. Any person willing to contribute to the effort is welcome, and contributions may include filing or participating in issues, creating pull requests, or helping others with such activities.

## Releases management

GitHub is the medium of record for all spec designs, use cases, and so on.

The human readable document is the source of truth. If using a JSON Schema again to document the spec, it is secondary to the human documentation. The documentation should live in a *.md file, in parallel to the latest document (versions/2.0.0.md for example).

At any given time, there would be at most 4 work branches. The branches would exist if work has started on them. Assuming a current version of 1.0.0:

* `main` - Current stable version. No PRs would be accepted directly to modify the specification. PRs against supporting files can be accepted.

* `v1.0.1-dev` - The next PATCH version of the specification. This would include non-breaking changes such as typo fixes, document fixes, and wording clarifications.

* `v1.1.0-dev` - The next MINOR version.

* `v2.0.0-dev` - The next MAJOR version.

The `main` branch shall remain the current, released DPDS. We will describe and link the work branch(es) on the default [README.md](README.md) on the `main` branch.

Examples of how something is described currently vs. the proposed solution should accompany any change proposal.

New features should be done in feature branches/forks which, upon approval, are merged into the proper work branch.

An issue will be opened for each feature change. 

Each feature branch must be linked with an issue.

A new version of DPDS is released by merging a work branch into the `main` branch.
