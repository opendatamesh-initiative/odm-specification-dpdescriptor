## Asking questions
We wholeheartedly welcome your questions!  They're not just accepted, they're vital for fostering knowledge exchange within DPDS community. 
It's through these inquiries that the specification evolves, becoming progressively clearer and more user-friendly. Follow these steps to
ask questions:

* Search for existing [discussions](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/odm-specification-dpdescriptor/discussions) and [issues](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/odm-specification-dpdescriptor/issues) before creating a new question
* Post your question as a new [discussion](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/odm-specification-dpdescriptor/discussions) thread
* Clearly articulate your question and provide context if needed
* Use descriptive titles for easier searchability

## Adopting the Specification
The success of the specification is tied to its adoption. One of the most effective ways to contribute to its success 
is therefore to use it and share your experiences. These are some examples of how you can use the specification:

* Adopt the specification in your data management projects
* Make your data management tool compliant with the specification
* Implement an adapter tool to use a DPDS document together with third-party tool (ex. importers/exporters)
* Implement a utility tool to support the  development of a DPDS document (es. linter, validator, diff, composer, etc ...)
  
## Reporting Errors
Effectively reporting errors like typos, imprecision, ambiguity, and contradictions is a critical contribution to the success of the specification. 
Follow these steps to report an error:

* Check open issues and pull requests to ensure the error hasn't already been reported
* If you are unsure if what you have found is an actual error or not ask in the [discussion section](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/odm-specification-dpdescriptor/discussions) here on GitHub or in the `#dpds` channel on [Slack](#joining-the-conversation-on-slack)
* Report the error
    * Open a new [issue](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/odm-specification-dpdescriptor/issues)
    * Set a clear title that describes the error and facilitates search (e.g., "Typo in `Expectations Object` Description").
    * Explain what you found, including a reference to the part of the specification that contains the potential error
    * Suggest a change (if possible) to fix the error:
    * Specify if the proposed change is only editorial or has impacts on the specification
    * If the change to fix the error is just editorial you can also submit directly a pull request without opening an issue before
