# Governance Guide
This document describes the Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS) governance rules. 

These rules have been established to provide an open and transparent mechanism for governing DPDS Project.

This document will be adjusted as practicality dictate

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Technical Steering Committee
The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the sole entity authorized to make decisions regarding changes to the specification or its governance.

#### Responsibilities
The TSC is responsable for:

* evaluating and approving or rejecting proposed changes to the specification
* evaluating and approving or rejecting proposed changes to the governance
* evaluating and approving or rejecting proposals for TSC Member additions or removals
* evaluating and approving or rejecting proposals for DPDS Mantainer additions or removals
* appointing the TSC Chair

#### Adding a member
Everyone can ask to become a TSC Member by writing to [odm.info@quantyca.it](mailto:odm.info@quantyca.it). 

The TSC is responsible for evaluating all applications and accepting or rejecting them. 

Although applications are individual, it is not possible to have more than two members of TSC belonging to the same company. 

The TSC can have a maximum of 15 members, including the TSC Chair. Once this capacity is reached, adding new members requires either removing a current member or revising this governance rule.

If the number of TSC Members falls below  5, it is the responsibility of the TSC itself to mobilize to identify new members.

The current TSC Members can be found in [TSC.md](./TSC.md).

#### Removing a member
TSC Member removal is possible under the following circumstances:

* Direct request from the member
* absence from more than three consecutive TSC meetings
* violation of the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

The request to remove a member can be initiated by the member or by another TSC Member. The TSC is responsible for accepting or rejecting the removal proposals.
  
#### TSC Meetings
TSC meetings must be organized at least once a year to elect the TSC Chair. TSC meetings should be organized preferably not less than once a quarter. 

Every TSC Member can propose a new meeting. Once the data is scheduled and the agenda defined the meeting must be announced in the discussion session and pinned. 

Modifications to the agenda can be proposed in the associated discussion thread. 

All DPDS Community Members can participate in the TSC meeting. Meetings should be recorded.

### TSC Chair
The TSC chair presides over the TSC and is responsible for maintaining relationships with other projects both within and outside the [Open Data Mesh Initiative (ODMI)](https://initiative.opendatamesh.org/). 

#### Responsibilities
The TSC Chair is responsible for:

* maintaining relationships with external projects and organizations
* ensuring that the activities of the TSC are conducted following the governance rules described in this document
  
#### Election
The TSC Chair is elected annually. The TSC Chair is selected by the TSC among its members.

### Maintainers
DPDS Maintainers have write access to the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/odm-specification-dpdescriptor).
Maintainers collectively manage the project's resources and contributors.

The current DPDS Maintainers can be found in [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md).

#### Responsibilities
The DPDS Maintainers are responsible for:

* merging their patches or patches from others
* triaging issues
* moderating discussions

 The current development process followed by DPS Mantainers can be found in [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

#### Adding a maintainer
Everyone can ask to become a DPDS Manatiner by writing to [odm.info@quantyca.it](mailto:odm.info@quantyca.it)  

The TSC is responsible for evaluating all applications and accepting or rejecting them. 

Maintainers should be people who care about the DPDS project and want to help it grow and improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the DPDS community, get the most knowledgeable people to review spec and docs, champion RFCs, and follow through to fix issues (in spec or docs).

#### Removing a maintainer
DPDS Mantainer removal is possible under the following circumstances:

* direct request from the maintainer
* unavailability or prolonged inactivity
* violation of the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Decision process
While the DPDS Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC
decision requires a vote to move the DPDS Project forward, the voting members of the
TSC will vote on a one-vote per voting member basis.

Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least 3 voting members of
the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but
will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

Decisions by vote require a majority vote, provided quorum is met. In the case of electronic vote, the voting process
must be open for 48 hours.

In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, it's the TSC Chair responsibility to decide.
