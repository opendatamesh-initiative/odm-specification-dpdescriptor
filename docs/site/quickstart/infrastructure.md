# Infrastructural Components

[The previous page](./application.md) showed how to define the [application components](../concepts/README.md#application-components) that implement the services exposed by a [data product](../concepts/README.md#data-product) through its *ports*. This page explains how to define the [infrastructural components](../concepts/README.md#infrastructural-components) required to execute these applications.

## Infrastructural Component Object

Infrastructural components are internal components of a data product. This means that, while the interface components are publicly available on demand to all consumers, access to infrastructural components can be restricted.

All internal components of a data product are contained in the [Internal Components Object](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#internalComponentsObject), accessible through the `internalComponents` field in the root [Data Product Descriptor Entity](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#data-product-descriptor-entity). Within this object, the field `infrastructuralComponents` contains the list of all [Infrastructural Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#infrastructure-component) of the data product.

### Fields
An [Infrastructural Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#infrastructure-component) has the following two mandatory fields:

- `fullyQualifiedName` (string:fqn): This is the unique universal identifier of the component. It MUST be a URN of the form `urn:dpds:{mesh-namespace}:dataproducts:{product-name}:{product-major-version}:infrastructure:{infra-name}.`
- `version` (string:version): This is the <a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html" target="_blank">semantic version number</a> of the data product's infrastructural component. The  version of infrastructural components has no direct impact on the version of the data product they belong to. A change in the major version of an infrastructural component can anyway impact the version of one interface component and so indirectly the version of the data product.

Other non-mandatory descriptive fields like `platform` and `infrastructureType` are also available. Moreover, the [Infrastructural](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#infrastructure-component) Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#infrastructure-component) can be extended with other fields  with **"x-" prefix** as needed.


### Example
The following example shows two infrastructural components that respectively describe 

1. The topology of Kafka topics required to store
    - *technical events* generated by the `cdcIngestion` application while offloading data from the *TMS source*. 
    - *domain events* generated by `eventProcessor` application as a composition of technical events that belong to the same *transaction* intercepted by `cdcIngestion` on the *TMS source*.
1. The schema and tables required by `dbSinkConnector` application to materialize from streamed domain events the updated state of each *Trip*. 


```json
{
    "infrastructuralComponents": [
        {
            "fullyQualifiedName": "urn:dpds:com.company-xyz:dataproducts:tripExecution:1:infrastructure:eventStore",
            "version": "1.0.1",
            "description": "The kafka topics topology required to store technical events offloaded from TMS by the CDC and the domain events generetaed by eventProcessor application",
            "platform": "aws:eu-south-1:confluent",
            "infrastructureType":"storage-resource"
        }, {
            "fullyQualifiedName": "urn:dpds:com.company-xyz:dataproducts:tripExecution:1:infrastructure:stateStore",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "description": "The database used by dbSinkConnector application to store the Trip updated state",
            "platform": "aws:eu-south-1:postgress",
            "infrastructureType":"storage-resource"
        }
    ]
}
```

The information provided so far are useful to track the infrastructural assets related to a specific data product. There is not anyway sufficient information to allow an external agent to provision the infrastructure autonomously. To this end in the [Infrastructural Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#infrastructure-component) there is the `provisioningService` filed that is described in much detail in the next sections.

## Trip Execution Data Product Descriptor
The [Trip Execution Data Product](./example.md) is composed of two infrastructural components.

The following files contain the complete definition of these infrastructural components:

- <a href="https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/odm-specification-dpdescriptor/blob/main/examples/tripexecution/infra/state-store.json" target="_blank">state-store.json :fontawesome-brands-github:</a>


You can read it on GitHub or cut and paste its content to <a href="https://jsoncrack.com/editor" target="_blank">JSON Crack :octicons-link-external-24:</a> for more interactive visualization.

## Summary
This page has shown that:

- a data product is composed not only of its public interface but also of internal components
- infrastructural components required by application components that implement services exposed by a data product through its ports are internal components described through an [Infrastructural Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#infrastructuralComponent).
- [Infrastructural Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#infrastructuralComponent) contains general information related to the specific infrastructure component but also all the required information to provision the infrastructure in an automatic and reproducible way.
- the DPDS uses *infrastructure as code (IaC)*  to define how to provision infrastructure but does not enforce the use of any particular IaC tool, preserving in this way its [technology independence](../overview/README.md#principles).


[The next page](./components.md) describes how to reuse portions of a data product descriptor document to make it more readable and less redundant, reducing file size and maintenance cost.
