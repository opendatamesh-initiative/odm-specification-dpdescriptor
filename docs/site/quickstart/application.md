# Application Components

[The previous page](./interface.md) showed how to define the [interface of services exposed](../concepts/README.md#interface-components) by a [data product](../concepts/README.md#data-product). This page explains how to define the [application components](../concepts/README.md#application-components) that implement these services.

## Application Component
Application components are internal components of a data product. This means that, while the interface components are publicly available on demand to all consumers, access to application components can be restricted. 

All internal components of a data product are contained in the [Internal Components Object](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#internalComponentsObject), accessible through the `internalComponents` field in the root [Data Product Descriptor Entity](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#data-product-descriptor-entity). Within this object, the field `applicationComponents` contains the list of all [Application Components](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#applicationComponent) of the data product.

### Fields
An [Application Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#applicationComponent) has the following two mandatory fields:

- `fullyQualifiedName` (**string:fqn**): This is the unique universal identifier of the component. It MUST be a URN of the form `urn:dpds:{mesh-namespace}:dataproducts:{product-name}:{product-major-version}:applications:{app-name}`
- `version` (**string:version**): This is the <a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html" target="_blank">semantic version number</a> of the data product's application component. The version of application components has no direct impact on the version of the data product they belong to. A change in the major version of an application component can anyway impact the version of one interface component and so indirectly the version of the data product.

Other non-mandatory descriptive fields like `platform` and `applicationType` are also available. Moreover, the [Application Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#applicationComponent) can be extended with other fields with **"x-" prefix** as needed.

### Example
The following example shows three application components that respectively describe 
1. an application that loads data from a downstream legacy system (i.e. *TMS*)  in real-time to CDC technology (i.e. *Debezium*).
1. a streaming application that transforms the technical events loaded in the streaming platform (i.e. *Confluent platform*) by the previous application in domain events.
a streaming application that uses the domain events generated by the previous application to update the trip status in a downstream table stored in a Postgres DB.

All three applications are deployed in `eu-south-1` region of *AWS Cloud*.

```json
{
    "applicationComponents": [
        {
            "fullyQualifiedName": "urn:dpds:com.company-xyz:dataproducts:tripExecution:1:applications:cdcIngestion",
            "version": "1.0.1",
            "description": "The app that offload the Trip aggregate from  TMS using CDC",
            "platform": "aws:eu-south-1:debezium",
            "applicationType":"stream-sourcing"
        }, {
            "fullyQualifiedName": "urn:dpds:com.company-xyz:dataproducts:tripExecution:1:applications:eventProcessor",
            "version": "1.1.0",
            "description": "The app that transform tecnical events in domain events",
            "platform": "aws:eu-south-1:confluent",
            "applicationType":"stream-transformation"
        }, {
            "fullyQualifiedName": "urn:dpds:com.company-xyz:dataproducts:tripExecution:1:applications:dbSinkConnector",
            "version": "1.1.3",
            "description": "The app that store the updated state of a Trip in the target postgres db",
            "platform": "aws:eu-south-1:confluent",
            "applicationType":"stream-transformation"
        }
    ]
}
```

The information provided so far are useful to track the application assets related to a specific data product. There is not anyway sufficient information to allow an external agent to build and deploy the application autonomously. To this end in the [Application Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#applicationComponent), there are the `buildService` and `deploymentService` fields that are described in much detail in the next sections.

## Trip Execution Data Product Descriptor
The [Trip Execution Data Product](./example.md) is composed of three application components.

The following files contain the complete definition of these application components:

## Summary
This page has shown that:

- a data product is composed not only of its public interface but also of internal components
- applications that implement the exposed interfaces are internal components described through an [Application Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#applicationComponent).
- [Application Component](../resources/specifications/1.0.0-DRAFT.md#applicationComponent) contains general information related to the specific application but also all the required information to build and deploy the application in an automatic and reproducible way.
- the DPDS uses *pipeline as code* to define how to build and deploy an application but does not enforce the use of any particular CICD tool, preserving in this way its [technology independence](../overview/README.md#principles).

[The next page](./infrastructure.md) describes the contents of the `infrastructuralComponents` field used to provide all the required information to provision the infrastructure required by application components that implement the services exposed by the product through its ports.
